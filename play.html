   <br><h3>SAM AVERAGE[D]</h3></br>

     _An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
     Night, shortly before dawn._

    <br>_On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
     earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
     darkness, the scenic background._</br>

     <br> _Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
     from its standard._</br>

     <br> _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
     hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.</br>

     <br> _On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
     blanket thrown about his shoulders_.</br>


    <h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>[_With a singing call._]</p> <p>Four o'clock!--All's well!</p>

    <p>[_Jumping down from the embankment]</p> <p>he approaches the fire._</p>

    <h3>ANDREW.</h3><p>By God, Joel, it's bitter.</p>

    <h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>[_Rubbing his hands over the coals._]</p> <p>A mite sharpish.</p>

    <h3>ANDREW.</h3> <p>[_Looks up eagerly._]</p><p>What?</p>

    <h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'</p>

    <h3>ANDREW.</h3><p>[_Sinks back, gloomily._]</p>Oh! <p> [_A pause._]</p><p>I wondered you should
        agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--</p> <p>[_A pause again._]</p> </br>

    <br><h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</p></br>

    <br><h3>ANDREW.</h3> <p>Life.</p></br>
