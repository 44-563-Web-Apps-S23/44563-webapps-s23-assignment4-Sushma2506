SAM AVERAGE[D]

     _An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
     Night, shortly before dawn._

     _On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
     earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
     darkness, the scenic background._

     _Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
     from its standard._

     _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
     hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.

     _On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
     blanket thrown about his shoulders_.


JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!

     [_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._

ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.

JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.

ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?

JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.

ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._

JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?

ANDREW. Life.
