   <br>SAM AVERAGE[D]</br>

    <br> _An intrenchment in Canada, near Niagara Falls, in the year 1814.
     Night, shortly before dawn._</br>

    <br>_On the right, the dull glow of a smouldering wood fire ruddies the
     earthen embankment, the low-stretched outline of which forms, with
     darkness, the scenic background._</br>

     <br> _Near the centre, left, against the dark, a flag with stars floats
     from its standard._</br>

     <br> _Beside the fire_, ANDREW, _reclined, gazes at a small frame in his
     hand; near him is a knapsack, with contents emptied beside it_.</br>

     <br> _On the embankment_, JOEL, _with a gun, paces back and forth, a
     blanket thrown about his shoulders_.</br>


     <br>JOEL. [_With a singing call._] Four o'clock!--All's well!</br>

     <br>[_Jumping down from the embankment, he approaches the fire._</br>

     <br>ANDREW. By God, Joel, it's bitter.</br>

     <br>JOEL. [_Rubbing his hands over the coals._] A mite sharpish.</br>

     <br>ANDREW. [_Looks up eagerly._] What?</br>

     <br>JOEL. Cuts sharp, for Thanksgivin'.</br>

     <br>ANDREW. [_Sinks back, gloomily._] Oh! [_A pause._] I wondered you should
        agree with me. You meant the weather. I meant--[_A pause again._</br>

    <br>JOEL. Well, Andy, what'd you mean?</br>

    <br>ANDREW. Life.</br>
